#### Introduction
The Onion Router (Tor) browser is a modified version of Firefox meant to allow anonymous internet browsing by concealing users' IP addresses, making it nearly hard to track them down without extreme means. Tor is noted for its simplicity and effective anonymity, requiring little technical knowledge to operate. While other anonymous surfing solutions exist, Tor is one of the most simple and user-friendly, allowing anyone with an internet connection to browse and interact without disclosing their identity.

#### History and Intended Use of The Onion Router:
The US government created Tor in 2002 to provide for anonymous and unrestrained internet communication. Its principal goals are to circumvent government censorship, protect whistleblowers, and ensure communication privacy. Tor, like any tool, can be misused for illegal purposes. Tor is no longer controlled by the US government and is now open-source, with contributions from privacy specialists throughout the world. Interestingly, the US government, which founded Tor, is also looking into ways to deanonymize its users.

#### How The Onion Router Works:
Tor routers user traffic through randomly selected relays (entry, middle, exit) enhancing anonymity by stripping layers of encryption at each relay. The exit relay only remembers the last relay, and the routes vary every 10 minutes, making tracking difficult. This procedure is analogous to mailing a letter to numerous persons, with each person only seeing the outermost layer, much like Tor works with encryption.

#### Tracking Criminals Using TOR:

Tracking criminals on Tor is challenging, the majority of successful cases are the result of suspects making mistakes rather than violating Tor's protection. For example, the FBI once used a Firefox flaw to obtain users' IP addresses. While Tor ensures anonymity, users can mistakenly reveal their IP address by changing settings or permitting specific scripts.

Researchers investigate methods for identifying users, but most demand advanced resources. Investigators frequently attempt to discover the suspect's IP address via tracking codes in emails or documents, but these tactics are risky. If direct tracking fails, investigators employ open-source intelligence to connect suspects with their Dark Web identities.

Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, was apprehended after using his real name and email address online, which linked him to his Dark Web persona. In business environments, tracking

## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR. If you got TOR installed in the class, you can write this part from memory. Make not of it if you're writing it from memory and not as you work).
