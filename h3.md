## Cloud code Security: How CSPM Can Help to Secure Your Cloud and Avoid Configuration Disasters 
#### Presentation was given by  Mikael Nilsson, Product Security Lead – Customer Intelligence R&D, SAS institute 
The mission of SAS  is “ To be the most trustworthy analytics partner on the planet”  and 
Vision: “ To provide knowledge that matters at the moment. 
Nilsson said their company- SAS built analysis software and he mentioned some of their software such as SAS as well as specific solutions. He worked specifically in the marketing product space and their main product is Customer 360 which actually used to reimaging marketing  with trusted analytics and powerful decision-making. CI 360 is a hybrid multi-tenant software as a service that includes both cloud-hosted and software deployed on-premises. He also mentioned that they follow DevSecOps methodologies & CI/CD to deliver features for our customers at high velocity.  
He mentioned that the Verizon 2023 Data breach investigation reports showed misconfiguration errors are getting higher and higher because cloud infrastructure has been used more and more. That’s why it is easy for configuration slip to occur which causes some of the cloud services insecure. OWASP TOP 10: 2021 also examined 90% of the applications they examined found some form of misconfiguration. 

### How Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) works: 
Then he revealed an imaginary example regarding this issue and how and where CSPM could help. Suppose a developer built a software application that ensures thread modeling in plan face, Static application scanning test (SAST), Dynamic application scanning (DAST), Interactive application scanning (IAST), Software composition Analysis, and Host and container scanning as well as a run-time application for self-protection. Then he addressed when this application stored on the internet through cloud service or SQL server allows unrestricted inbound access or publicly accessible BigQuery dataset that actually not protected. Those are part of cloud infrastructure which is an unprotected or high-risk area. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) addresses those high-risk scenarios, which is not actually outside of the application, which is the infrastructure misconfiguration. CSPM find out this high-risk area and they mitigated risk in any infrastructure and made it harder to the attracter to move forward.

### What is CSMP:  
CSPM is a tool that has compliance rules or rules set base on frameworks, regulations, and enterprise policy. It is used to detect findings or security misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure ( Compute, Storage or Network). CSMP gives manual and automated responses when it detects any problem. CSMP has open-source products and proprietary products. So any company will do its own research which understand product suitable for them. Then he showed some of  CSMP products to measure frameworks and compliance. More generic one are ISO/IEC 27001 and SOC 2 and more specific one GDPR compliance or PCI-DSS compliance. 
Finally, he discussed how to findings approach. Regular CSMP meetings essential figure out  three kinds of finding and mitigate those
•	Mitigate threat finding by CSMP tools which are low risk of implementation but high impact
•	Mitigate threat finding by CSMP tools which are high risk of implementation and high impact both.
•	Mitigate threat findings by CSMP tools that affect a high volume of hosts or which is a massive threat.

Finally, he showed the posture interface, which could be modified by the company by their own way. The interface gives a nice view to overlook how easily any company could see their high, medium, and critical threats on the interface. 
Overall, in his presentation, he talked about cloud security posture management and why it is a matter of concern especially why it matters to application developers. Then he also said what CSPM means and how it achieves those things that we need to do to ensure any company’s cloud security. 

# a) Bandit oh-five. Solve Over The Wire: Bandit the first five levels (0-4).
### Bandit Level 0
Level Goal
The goal of this level is to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1. I have given below my solution of this part:

### Bandit Level 0 → Level 1
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game. To do this I wrote the command readme in the terminal and then get the password. Here in below my solution screenshot.

### Bandit Level 1 → Level 2
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.  
Using bandit1 password from readme log in bandit1 then wrote command ls -alps to get the list from this list. Then wrote commend cat ./- to retrive password of this level. Here is my solution screenshot:

### Bandit Level 2 → Level 3
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.
Log in password from level 2 log in bandit2 then again write the command ls -alps to get the list from this list. The write terminal command cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename to get bandit 3 password. Here is my solution below:

### Bandit Level 3 → Level 4
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
Log in again using bandit3 password from previous level then write car inhere after that write ls -a to get hidden file name. Then write the command in terminal cat ...Hiding-From- You. Here is my solution below:

## b) Can't fish. Disable networking and show that packets don't go through. For example, use 'ping 1.1.1.1' (Cloudfare DNS server) or 'ping 8.8.8.8' (Google DNS server).

### Test after disable network: 
I have used the ping command to test the connection to external servers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8). The ping command sends packets to a specified IP address and waits for a response to determine if the network is functioning. Here is my solution after disabling the internet and Ethernet connection. 

It shows the message "Network is unreachable" This indicates that the packets can't be sent because there's no network connection available. This shows that the network is disabled.  "Request timeout for icmp_seq X" means the packets that were supposed to reach the destination (in this case, 8.8.8.8) did not get a response, and they timed out, Wich confirms network down. 

### Test after enabling network: 
After enabling the internet and Ethernet I wrote again ping 8.8.8.8 now it's shown below solution:

This means 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8 so the server 8.8.8.8 responded to the packet. icmp_seq is the  Sequence number of the packet. That means the network is active.




# c) Local only. Portscan your own computer using "localhost" address. It's illegal to portscan computers you don't own. Disconnect computer from the Internet while testing. Analyze your results.
# d) Daemon. Install a daemon (a server application) and port scan again. For example, you could install Apache web server or OpenSSH secure remote shell. Analyze the differences to scan without the daemon.
