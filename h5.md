Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg

## a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)

#### gnupg is  a tool that allows us to encrypt and decrypt messages using PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) public key cryptography. Steps are given below: 
##### First, install gnupg in my Linux by writing in terminal. 
* sudo apt update
* sudo apt install GnuPG (screenshot is given below)

##### Generate Key pair: A key pair consists of public key and and a private key. To do this open teminal and run this command to generate a new key pair 
   Then step by step choose the following option:
   * Choose RSA and RSA (option 1).
   * Choose a key size 4096 bits
   * Choose the key to never expire
   * Enter name and email address when prompted.
   * Create a strong passphrase to protect my private key.
     Then GPG will create  key pair.

##### Export my public key: To Export my public key run this command to export my public key into a file
 * gpg --armor --export srabonty.shokal@example.com > srabonty-key.asc
 This file will be exported in my directory. Then share this file with whom I want to share by email or other way.

##### Encrypt a Message: To send an encrypted message to someone, I need their public key. For example, I  already have the recipient's public key file e.g., zahid-public-key.asc). To import the recipient public key write the command in the terminal: 
*gpg --import recipient-public-key.asc
  
##### Create a file name called mess.text and run this by command line: 
*echo "This is a secret message for you, keep it secret ." > mess.txt

##### Encrypt the message for a recipient: Run this command to encrypt mess.txt 
*gpg --encrypt --recipient zahid360@example.com mess.txt
Then send this file mess.text to the recipient. 

##### Decrypt a Message: When the recipient gets this mess.text he will decrypt is message by using private key I have send. To decrypt recipent will run the command line in the terminal like this: 
*gpg --decrypt mess.txt.gpg
It will  be asked to enter my passphrase (the one I created when generating our key pair).

GPG will then display the decrypted message.



## b) Password manager is open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without the cloud and 2) is free, open-source software. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

#### password manager, open and cloudless means password manager my password without syncing through the cloud, the database stored and managed locally. It is free and open source ensures transparency and user strong control. 

#### I have chosen a password manager called Keepass which is open source and licensed under GPL (General Public License). The password is stored locally on my computer in an encrypted format (AES-256-bit encryption). Though it offers optional cloud syncing through plugins, by default it does not require or use cloud services.

#### At first I downloaded software to the official KeePass website: https://keepass.info/. Then follow the instructions and install in my windows. 

#### Create a New password database: Open my KeePass click the file  new then choose the location of the password database locally. Then set a strong master password. It should be remembered by myself. 

#### Add Enties: Click Entry  then Add Entry. Then Enter details of the website, username, and password. KeePass has an option to create strong random passwords automatically, helping you create more secure credentials. Finally, click ok.

#### How to Access Stored Password: To access a password, double-click the entry or copy the password stored in KeePass and paste it there. 

#### Backup: Though it is not cloud syncing, so manual backup is essential. We can copy this .kdbx file to an external drive or encrypted USB stick.

### Why Password Manager is needed: 
* Attackers may try to guess or brute force weak passwords. Password managers could help give strong and unique passwords.
* Many users reuse passwords across multiple sites so this KeePass password manager.
* It is not syncing by cloud so it's there is no possibility of hacking.
* Phishing emails or websites trick users into providing credentials. A password manager can help mitigate this by only auto-filling credentials on legitimate websites.
* In a Man-in-the-middle attack, hackers intercept communication between a user and a website. KeePass password manager with strong encryption and two-factor authentication (2FA) protects against this by keeping passwords encrypted and requiring extra security steps, making it hard for attackers to steal or use my passwords.
