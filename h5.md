## a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)



## b) Password manager, open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without the cloud and 2) is free, open-source software. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.

#### password manager, open and cloudless means password manager my password without syncing through the cloud, the database stored and managed locally. It is free and open source ensures transparency and user strong control. 

#### I have chosen a password manager called Keepass which is open source and licensed under GPL (General Public License). The password is stored locally on my computer in an encrypted format (AES-256-bit encryption). Though it offers optional cloud syncing through plugins, by default it does not require or use cloud services.

#### At first I downloaded software to the official KeePass website: https://keepass.info/. Then follow the instructions and install in my windows. 

#### Create a New password database: Open my KeePass click the file  new then choose the location of the password database locally. Then set a strong master password. It should be remembered by myself. 

#### Add Enties: Click Entry  then Add Entry. Then Enter details of the website, username, and password. KeePass has an option to create strong random passwords automatically, helping you create more secure credentials. Finally, click ok.

#### How to Access Stored Password: To access a password, double-click the entry or copy the password stored in KeePass and paste it there. 

#### Backup: Though it is not cloud syncing, so manual backup is essential. We can copy this .kdbx file to an external drive or encrypted USB stick.

### Why Password Manager is needed: 
* Attackers may try to guess or brute force weak passwords. Password managers could help give strong and unique passwords.
* Many users reuse passwords across multiple sites so this KeePass password manager.
* It is not syncing by cloud so it's there is no possibility of hacking.
* Phishing emails or websites trick users into providing credentials. A password manager can help mitigate this by only auto-filling credentials on legitimate websites.
* In a Man-in-the-middle attack, hackers intercept communication between a user and a website. KeePass password manager with strong encryption and two-factor authentication (2FA) protects against this by keeping passwords encrypted and requiring extra security steps, making it hard for attackers to steal or use my passwords.
