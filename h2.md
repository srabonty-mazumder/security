## Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

The advantages of computer and network world security and risk factors become so complex that only anti-virus or software updates are not enough. Recent era, new class of threats known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)  has introduced by targeting most valuable data of the military or economy. APT poses significant attribution and adverse threat which could not be possible to remove my regular antivirus. The traditional incident response method fails to respond to risk that is possessed by APT intrusions because of two assumptions response should happen after the point of compromise, and the compromise was the result of a fixable flaw. Several high-profile incidents, including attacks on NASA, reveal APT actors' success in compromising and removing sensitive information. 
Epstein and Elgin (2008) of Business Week mentioned many incidents of intrusions into NASA and other government networks where APT actors were undetected and successful in removing sensitive high-performance rocket design information which was very Alarming. In another report prepared by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Krekel (2009) profiles an advanced intrusion with extensive detail demonstrating the patience and calculated nature of APT.
Advances in infrastructure management tools have facilitated the most effective practice of enterprise-wide patching and hardening, reducing the most easily accessible vulnerabilities in networked service. However, APT actors also could compromise the system using advanced tools, customized malware, and zero-day exploits that bypass traditional defenses like anti-virus and patching. That’s why to response against API requires an evolution in analysis, processes, and technology. In this paper describes an intelligence-driven, threat-focused approach to study intrusions from the adversaries’ perspective. Every separate phase of the intrusion is mapped to courses of action for detection, mitigation, and response. Basically phrase “kill chain” describes the structure of every intrusion and related guided analysis to take actionable security intelligence.   Along with this model defenders can develop resilient mitigations against intruders and intelligently prioritize investments in new technology or processes. The paper is structured as follows sections: Section Two covers related work on phase-based defense models, Section Three introduces a new intelligence-driven computer network defense model, section four applies the model to a real case study, and section five summarizes key points and suggests areas for future research.
