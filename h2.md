## Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

The advantages of computer and network world security and risk factors become so complex that only anti-virus or software updates are not enough. Recent era, new class of threats known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)  has introduced by targeting most valuable data of the military or economy. APT poses significant attribution and adverse threat which could not be possible to remove my regular antivirus. The traditional incident response method fails to respond to risk that is possessed by APT intrusions because of two assumptions response should happen after the point of compromise, and the compromise was the result of a fixable flaw. Several high-profile incidents, including attacks on NASA, reveal APT actors' success in compromising and removing sensitive information. 

Epstein and Elgin (2008) of Business Week mentioned many incidents of intrusions into NASA and other government networks where APT actors were undetected and successful in removing sensitive high-performance rocket design information which was very Alarming. In another report prepared by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Krekel (2009) profiles an advanced intrusion with extensive detail demonstrating the patience and calculated nature of APT.

Advances in infrastructure management tools have facilitated the most effective practice of enterprise-wide patching and hardening, reducing the most easily accessible vulnerabilities in networked service. However, APT actors also could compromise the system using advanced tools, customized malware, and zero-day exploits that bypass traditional defenses like anti-virus and patching. That’s why to response against API requires an evolution in analysis, processes, and technology. In this paper describes an intelligence-driven, threat-focused approach to study intrusions from the adversaries’ perspective. Every separate phase of the intrusion is mapped to courses of action for detection, mitigation, and response. Basically phrase “kill chain” describes the structure of every intrusion and related guided analysis to take actionable security intelligence.   Along with this model defenders can develop resilient mitigations against intruders and intelligently prioritize investments in new technology or processes. The paper is structured as follows sections: Section Two covers related work on phase-based defense models, Section Three introduces a new intelligence-driven computer network defense model, Section Four applies the model to a real case study, and Section Five summarizes key points and suggests areas for future research.

## Related Work

In the military and information security context, different kinds of phase-based models have been used for defense and countermeasures. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense and Air Force follow kill chain models with stages of find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess for operations and intelligence, while threat chains are applied to counter IED attacks. Finally, the security company Mandiant proposes an “exploitation life cycle” that does not map courses of defensive action and is based on post-compromise actions but also moves forward detections and mitigations to earlier phases of the intrusion.
## Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense

Intelligence-driven computer network defense (CND) is a risk management strategy that focuses on analyzing adversaries' capabilities, objectives, and limitations to continuously counter emerging threats.

### Indicators and the Indicator Life Cycle:

The fundamental element of intelligence in this model is the indicator. Indicators can be subdivided into three types:

•	Atomic: Typically IP address, email, and vulnerability identifiers are examples of atomic which cannot be broken down into smaller parts and retain their meaning in the context of an intrusion.

•	Computed: Computed indicators are those which are derived from data involved in an incident.

•	Behavioral: It is a collection of computed and atomic indicators subject to qualification by quantity and possibly combinatorial logic.

From the indicator life cycle illustrated in Figure 1, this cycle of actions, and the corresponding indicator states,. This applies to all indicators indiscriminately, regardless of their accuracy or applicability. 

### Intrusion Kill Chain

A kill chain is a systematic process that targets  and engages a challenger to create desired effects. US military defines this process by following steps such as find, fix, track, target, engage, assess (F2T2EA): find adversary targets suitable for engagement; fix their location; track and observe; target with suitable weapon or asset to create desired effects; engage adversary; assess effects. Every step is integrated and end to end that is why it’s called “chain” because one insufficiency will interrupt the entire process.  
Computer network attack (CNA) or computer network espionage (CNE) defined the phases of the kill chain in are following way: 
1.	Reconnaissance: Attracter  research and identify their target as well  as gather information from different sources like conferences, websites, and mailing lists.
	
2.	Weaponization: Using different official documents attackers combine a remote access trojan with an exploit to create a deliverable payload.
	
3.	Delivery: The payload is transmitted to the target via email attachments, websites, or USB devices.
	
4.	Exploitation: Once the payload is delivered successfully, attackers execute their code to exploit the system and create a target application or operating system vulnerability.
	
5.	Installation: Attackers install a backdoor or trojan on the victim's system to maintain persistent access.
	
6.	Command and Control (C2): Compromised systems communicate with an external server, allowing attackers to manually control the system.

7.	Actions on Objectives: Attackers achieve their goals, often data exfiltration, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network.

### Courses of Action

The intrusion kill chain model provides actionable intelligence by aligning defensive capability with specific adversaries applied in a target enterprise. In this approach, the defender can measure their performance as well effectiveness of these actions, and plan investment roadmaps to rectify any capability gaps. The course of action matrix shows different defended actions: detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and destroy. By addressing all phases of the kill chain is the goal of creating a resilient defense. Defenders force adversaries to continuously adapt, increasing their costs and reducing the likelihood of successful intrusions, by fully utilizing indicators and mitigating repeated patterns.

### Intrusion Reconstruction:

Kill chain analysis helps to identify available information and guides to take a defensive course of action. This is a model to analyze the intrusion in a new way. Detected intrusions typically reveal limited attributes about one phase, but analysts must uncover details from all phases to maximize defensive options. It is always important to analyze or find an attack in the earlier phases to mitigate future intrusions, as conventional incident response often begins too late, after the exploit phase. In the kill chain defenders must move detection and response earlier, understanding that adversaries often reuse tools and infrastructure across multiple phases. Defenders can impose forces on adversaries to protect each phase of the attack, raising their costs and improving resilience by thoroughly analyzing both successful and unsuccessful intrusions. These two figures show how what happens if an intrusion is identified in the early stage of kill change rather than later. In the kill chain defenders must move detection and response earlier, understanding that adversaries often reuse tools and infrastructure across multiple phases.
