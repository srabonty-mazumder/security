## x) Read and summarize OWASP: OWASP 10 2021:
### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
According to OWASP Top 10, 2021, Broken Access Control is considered the most significant security risk. From the 318000 database, 94% of applications were found to have some form of broken access control, with an average incidence rate  of 3.81%
#### Description: Users cannot  act outside of their intended permission, which is called access control enforces policy. This kind of failure occurs due to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits. Some common vulnerabilities are : 
•	Violating the principle of least privilege, where access is granted to anyone.

•	Using an attack tool to manipulate API requests to tamper, and bypass access.

•	Using a unique identifier, permit viewing or editing someone else's account.

•	Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE.

•	Privilege escalation, metadata manipulation using JSON Web Token (JWT), and CORS misconfiguration to allow API access to unauthorize/untrust origin. 
#### How to prevent: 
•	By default deny public resources. 

•	Centralized and re-use access control mechanisms across applications. 

•	Model access control mechanisms enforce record ownership.

•	Log access control failures, and alert admins when appropriate.

•	Limit API & controlled access to minimize  harm from automated attack tools. 

#### Example Scenario:
•	SQL Injection via URL Parameter

•	Forced Browsing

### A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration:
According to OWASP Top 10, 2021 Security Misconfiguration 90% of applications were tested with some form of misconfiguration with an average rate of 4.%, and over 208k occurrences of a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) in this risk category. 
#### Description: Improper or incomplete security set causes security misconfiguration. 
•	Missing appropriate security hardening in any part of the application could  cause illegal access to cloud. 

•	Unnecessary features are enabled or installed.

•	Default accounts and passwords remain enabled and unchanged.

•	Exposure of detailed error messages to the user.

•	Failure to implement the latest security patches.

•	Less secure settings in application servers, frameworks, or libraries.
#### How to prevent: 
•	Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment.

•	Delete or not install unused features and frameworks.

•	As a part of the patch processing process  review and update all security notes, updates, and patches.

•	Sending security directives to clients such as Security Headers.

•	Use a segmented application architecture to provide effective and secure separation between components or tenants 
#### Example scenarios:
•	Misconfigured cloud storage permission could access the attracter for unauthorized access.

•	Error messages can reveal sensitive information or vulnerabilities to the attacker.

### A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Vulnerable and outdated components, which moved up from the second spot in the OWASP Top 10, 2021 community survey, pose a significant risk.
#### Description: Some of the most comment-vulnerable and outdated components are:
•	From the clients and server side don’t track or update components.

•	Use vulnerable, unsupported, and outdated software across that stack.

•	Don’t scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins related to the components that use.

•	Don’t fix or upgrade underlying platforms, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion.

•	Developers don’t test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries.

•	Don’t secure the components’ configurations.
### How to prevent: 
•	Take off unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.

•	Use tools like OWASP Dependency Check to monitor for vulnerabilities.

•	Obtain components  from official, secure  sources and use signed packages.

•	Regularly monitor unmaintained libraries and deploy virtual patches if necessary.
### Example Scenarios:
Outdated components can allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-5638 in Struts 2, which led to major breaches, or unpatched IoT devices vulnerable to Heartbleed.

### A03:2021 – Injection
According to OWASP Top 10, 2021 Injection is considered the most significant security risk. From the 274K database, 94% of applications were found to have some form of broken access control, with a max incidence rate of 19%, and an average incidence rate of 3%.
#### Description:
An application is vulnerable to attack when:
•	User data in the application is not validated, filtered, and sanitized.

•	Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.

•	Hostile data is directly used in queries or object-relational mapping (ORM) parameters.
  #### How to Prevent: 
•	Use safe API which avoids using the interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).

•	Use positive server-side input validation.

•	In dynamic queries  use escape syntax  for special characters.

•	To prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection, use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries.
#### Example scenarios: 
Attackers can modify query parameters to inject malicious code, for example using SQL UNION to retrieve unauthorized data or execute commands.
