Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Sections 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
2.3 One-Way Functions
Definition: A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction (find f(x) from x) but extremely difficult to reverse (find x from f(x)).
Analogy: Schneier compares this to breaking a plate—easy to smash, nearly impossible to piece back together.
Existence: No formal proof that one-way functions exist, but many functions behave as if they are one-way (e.g., squaring is easy, but taking square roots is harder in certain cases).
Trapdoor One-Way Functions: These are one-way functions with a "trapdoor" or secret information that allows easy reversal.
Example: Taking apart a watch—hard to reassemble without instructions (trapdoor), but easy with them.
Used extensively in public-key cryptography to allow secure communication.
2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
Definition: A one-way hash function takes an input (pre-image) and produces a fixed-length output (hash), making it easy to compute the hash but hard to reverse.
Collision Resistance: It’s difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.
Use Case: Verifying file integrity or message authenticity by comparing hash values.
Even a small change in the input will drastically alter the hash output, making it easy to detect tampering.
Message Authentication Codes (MACs): Combines hash functions with a secret key.
Ensures that only someone with the key can verify the integrity of a message.
Provides an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized tampering.

## a) Install Hashcat. Test it with a sample hash. See Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat
#### Install Hashcat: To install Hashcat I opened my Debian Linux and then wrote in the terminal below command:
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
  ![a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c2db6cc-ad8d-404f-9560-e346d7949c7e)

#### Create a new directory for my work and get the most popular big directory Rockyou:
* mkdir hashed
* cd hashed
* wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
* ar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
* m rockyou.txt.tar.gz
  ![aa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94844f0-e9da-4bd7-8a82-c7dc79943563)
  
Write the command to see the list of rockyou 
* head rockyou.txt
to know total number of password list in rockyou by writing below command
* wc -l rockyou.txt

![aaa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0de49181-a83c-470a-9586-990d283c612b)

#### To Crack this hash first need to identify hash type by writing the command below:
* hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
It shows the possibility m parameter list

##### Crack the hash: To crack this hash I will write below command to terminal 
hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
* -m 0 means type of the hash, the number we obtained from 'hashid' or 'hashcat.
* -o solved means save the solution as plain text to a new file "solved" in working directory
My practice is given below:

## b) Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df.
##### To Crack this hash first need to identify hash type by writing the command below:
* hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df
It shows the possibility m parameter list like below picture:
![bb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b3628ec-1a15-4c8f-b807-7d8e0dbf4e66)


##### Crack the hash: To crack this hash I will write below command to terminal 
hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
* -m 0 means type of the hash, the number we obtained from 'hashid' or 'hashcat.
* -o solved means save the solution as plain text to a new file "solved1" in working directory
My practice is given below:

## m) Voluntary: Compile John the Ripper, Jumbo version. Karvinen 2023: Crack File Password With John.

#### Step 1: Install prerequisites app: first need to install below prerequisites app-
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get -y install micro bash-completion git build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlib-gst libbz2-1.0 libbz2-dev atool zip wget. My practice screenshot is given after every command

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6468ea9c-c40f-4bc9-9690-1c4f2cf6f799)

#### Step 2: Download & Compile John the Ripper, Jumbo version
Then download and compile john the Ripper by below command: 
* git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openwall/john.git
  
![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0b65a53-2cd3-4318-923d-f2ea803dfe25)
  
####  Step 3: Compile
*	cd john/src/	
* ./configure
* $ make -s clean && make -sj4

  ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ead7e55-09e4-442c-bc1d-8cb87ec70ebc)

#### Step 4: John is compiled, now I will find the new executables and scripts in run/.
* cd ../run/
* ls -1

#### Step 5>: Password Protected ZIP
* wget https://TeroKarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/tero.zip
* unzip tero.zip

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdd5787-d57c-48ea-ab9c-5e5ddd358c0a)


#### Step 6 : Crack ZIP Password by writing the command 
*  $HOME/john/run/zip2john tero.zip >tero.zip.hash
*  $HOME/john/run/john tero.zip.hash

  ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27c1111-3888-4dfb-a8b0-ad4e71d1b778)

## n) Voluntary: Crack a zip file password:
#####  Crack a zip file password I follow voluntary work m steps from 1 - 5, then crack a zip file password that was named 'srabonty.zip' as and stored in Downloads folder by writing the command below 
* $HOME/john/run/zip2john $HOME/Downloads/srabonty.zip > zip.hash
* $HOME/john/run/john zip.hash
##### My practices screenshot is given below:

![Crack zip file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b8486f6-7224-43a7-b78e-40d1a1523fc1)

The password is "sanaya"! Now that I know the password, now I could extract the ZIP using this password.
