â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## a) Install Hashcat. Test it with a sample hash. See Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat
#### Install Hashcat: To install Hashcat I opened my Debian Linux and then wrote in the terminal below command:
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

#### Create a new directory for my work and get the most popular big directory Rockyou:
* mkdir hashed
* cd hashed
* wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
* ar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
* m rockyou.txt.tar.gz
  ![aa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94844f0-e9da-4bd7-8a82-c7dc79943563)
  
Write the command to see the list of rockyou 
* head rockyou.txt
to know total number of password list in rockyou by writing below command
* wc -l rockyou.txt

#### To Crack this hash first need to identify hash type by writing the command below:
* hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
It shows the possibility m parameter list

##### Crack the hash: To crack this hash I will write below command to terminal 
hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
* -m 0 means type of the hash, the number we obtained from 'hashid' or 'hashcat.
* -o solved means save the solution as plain text to a new file "solved" in working directory
My practice is given below:

## b) Crack this hash: d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df.
##### To Crack this hash first need to identify hash type by writing the command below:
* hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df
It shows the possibility m parameter list like below picture:
![bb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b3628ec-1a15-4c8f-b807-7d8e0dbf4e66)


##### Crack the hash: To crack this hash I will write below command to terminal 
hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
* -m 0 means type of the hash, the number we obtained from 'hashid' or 'hashcat.
* -o solved means save the solution as plain text to a new file "solved1" in working directory
My practice is given below:
